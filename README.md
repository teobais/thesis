#Scrapper
Here's a typical execution of the scrapper script, which creates an <code>SQLite</code> database, from a given list of movies (a dummy text file):
<p align="center">
  <img  src="_img/scrapper_exec.PNG" alt="Sample use case" />
</p>

<i>The <code>generated</code> folder contains what is generated from the script(s): an <code>.sql</code> file and the final <code>SQLite</code> database that will be used from our app. Future versions of the scrapper will automatically create this folder and place the fore-mentioned files in it.</i>
